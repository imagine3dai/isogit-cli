implement igit, a complete git cli, in TypeScript with detailed command-line help and a comprehensive test suite using isomorphic-git. Use the latest version of isomorphic-git. Use best practices using async/await. Ensure you use the correct filesystem and http components that are used by isomorphic-git. Ensure each command and it's tests and documentation use individual files. Ensure each command supports a comprehensive set of subcommands (as needed), command line options and arguments as long as the associated behaviour is supported by isomorphic-git. Review the implementation of each command and test and address any errors identified. The help system should categorize commands, provide detailed command information, and provide examples with output and notes. It should also include a common uses section. Implement a theming for the help system and provide a set of themes. Include a detailed README and an MIT license. Also include a PROMPT file containing this prompt. Use strong TypeScript typing and ensure the code is well formatted and organized.

The following git commands should be supported:
git add
git branch
git checkout
git clone
git commit
git config
git fetch
git help
git init
git log
git pull
git push
git remote
git status
git tag
